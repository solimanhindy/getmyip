# getmyip
Get my public IPv4 address

# Why?
Well, a few weeks I subscribed to a new ISP. It is said that they
provide static IPv4 address. This is a script created to get my public
IPv4 address every day.

# Requirements
The requirements are easy. You need bash shell and curl.
Clone the repository, chmod 755 the script shell and add a crontab entry
(@daily /path/to/getmyip.sh)

Don't forget to edit the script file if you like to adjust the variables
or whatever.
